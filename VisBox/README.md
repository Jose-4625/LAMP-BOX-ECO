## Assembly Instructions
1. 3D print a single copy of all items (STL files)
2. You should end with 4 3D printed pieces
3. gather your electronic components:
    * 1 x 5V/12V breadboard powersupply
    * 1 x small piece of insulated wire
    * 4 x 100ohm Resistors
    * 4 x Clear Blue LEDs
    * 1 x (6cm x 8cm) prototyping PCB 
4. Along one of the short sides of the PCB, press fit the breadboard powersupply into the PCB perforations
    * if the bottom pins bend its okay, the hole spacing is slightly different from the pin spacing
5. Take note of which pins on the bottom are ground and which pins are positive, pins of the same polarity are aligned
6. Following the PCB holes in line with the positive pins, place an LED <cont'd>
